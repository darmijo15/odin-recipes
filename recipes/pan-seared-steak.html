    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8-16oz New York Strip or Ribeye</li>
      <li>canola oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves of peeled garlic</li>
      <li>fresh thyme</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take your steak out of the fridge about 1 hour before you intend to
        begin cooking. Season both sides liberally with kosher salt and freshly
        cracked black pepper. Allow the steak to sit out on a cutting board for
        the rest of the hour so it reaches room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the steak has sat out for an hour, heat a large cast iron skillet
        over medium-high heat. It should preheat for about 3-5 minutes, until it
        begins to smoke.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the skillet is done pre-heating, add about 2 tablespoons of canola
        oil to the skillet. Tilt the skillet around to spread out the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the steak in the skillet by laying it <strong>away</strong> from
        you so the oil doesn't hit you if it splatters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the steak to cook for 2 and a half minutes without touching or
        moving it so it develops a proper crust.
      </li>
      <li>After 2 and a half minutes have passed, flip the steak over.</li>
      <li>
        After 1 minute, crush both cloves of garlic. Add the garlic, thyme, and
        butter to the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spoon to mix around the garlic, thyme, and butter. Tilt the pan
        and use the spoon to baste the steak with the butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue basting until the second side of the steak has cooked a total 3
        minutes for a medium-rare steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the steak from the pan and place it on a clean cutting board.
        Cover the steak loosely with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the steak to rest for at leat 5 minutes but no more than 10.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the steak has finished resting, you are ready to serve. Enjoy!
      </li>
