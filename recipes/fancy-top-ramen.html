    <h1>Fancy Top Ramen</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When I go out to eat, one of my favorite foods to eat is ramen. The ramen
      served at Japanese restaurants is miles ahead of the instant ramen we all
      have eaten as a quick snack/meal. The problem for me was that when I lived
      in Pullman, WA, there weren't any good places around to get a proper bowl
      of ramen. I resorted to learning how ramen was made and seeing what I
      could do to spruce up my bowls of instant ramen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instant ramen consists of two components: noodles and a flavored broth. A
      proper bowl of ramen consists of five components: broth, tare (pronounced
      "tah-reh"), aroma oil, noodles, and toppings. Tare is a word meaning
      "sauce". It is added to the bottom of the bowl before the broth and adds
      umami and salt to the ramen. Each of the five ingredients of ramen are
      pretty complex to make from scratch, especially because there's a few
      different styles of ramen bowls you can make. So I figured the two main
      things I could do to make instant ramen more comparable to real ramen were
      add some good toppings and give the broth more flavor. I explored ramen
      recipes, tare recipes, and restaurant menus and was able to create some
      ramen at home that cured the cravings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One package of chicken flavored instant ramen</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Chili oil or sriracha</li>
      <li>One boneless chicken breast or thigh</li>
      <li>An egg</li>
      <li>Spinach</li>
      <li>Green onions</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Onion Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by butterflying your chicken breast so it'll cook more evenly (you
        most likely won't need to do this if you're using a chicken thigh).
        Season your chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a pan on medium-high heat, add a bit of canola oil, and sear the
        chicken on both sides for 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the pan to medium and continue flipping and cooking for another
        5-10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dice up the chicken. If it looks under cooked, you can throw the diced
        pieces back onto the pan for 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
