    <h1>Fancy Top Ramen</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When I go out to eat, one of my favorite foods to eat is ramen. The ramen
      served at Japanese restaurants is miles ahead of the instant ramen we all
      have eaten as a quick snack/meal. The problem for me was that when I lived
      in Pullman, WA, there weren't any good places around to get a proper bowl
      of ramen. I resorted to learning how ramen was made and seeing what I
      could do to spruce up my bowls of instant ramen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instant ramen consists of two components: noodles and a flavored broth. A
      proper bowl of ramen consists of five components: broth, tare (pronounced
      "tah-reh"), aroma oil, noodles, and toppings. Tare is a word meaning
      "sauce". It is added to the bottom of the bowl before the broth and adds
      umami and salt to the ramen. Each of the five ingredients of ramen are
      pretty complex to make from scratch, especially because there's a few
      different styles of ramen bowls you can make. So I figured the two main
      things I could do to make instant ramen more comparable to real ramen were
      add some good toppings and give the broth more flavor. I explored ramen
      recipes, tare recipes, and restaurant menus and was able to create some
      ramen at home that cured the cravings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One package of chicken flavored instant ramen</li>
      <li>Chicken broth</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Chili oil or sriracha</li>
      <li>One boneless chicken breast or thigh</li>
      <li>An egg</li>
      <li>Spinach</li>
      <li>Green onions</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Onion Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparing your toppings</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by butterflying your chicken breast so it'll cook more evenly (you
        most likely won't need to do this if you're using a chicken thigh).
        Season your chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a pan on medium-high heat, add a bit of canola oil, and sear the
        chicken on both sides for 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the pan to medium and continue flipping and cooking for another
        5-10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dice up the chicken. If it looks under cooked, you can throw the diced
        pieces back onto the pan for 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute your spinach in the leftover chicken fat/oil over medium-low heat
        for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place your egg in a saucepan and fill it with water until it is
        submerged about an inch.
      </li>
      <li>Bring the saucepan to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Once the water is boiling, cover the saucepan and pull it off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the pan to sit covered until the egg is cooked to your liking. It
        should take 4-6 minutes for a soft-boiled egg, 8-10 minutes for
        medium-boiled, and 12-14 minutes for hard-boiled. Most ramen restaurants
        I've been to typically serve it medium-boiled, but I prefer a soft-boil
        with a runny yolk.
      </li>
      <li>When the egg is done, remove it from the water and peel it.</li>
      <li>Dice up some of the green onion and set it aside for later.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Creating your Ramen bowl</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To begin preparing the final product, grab the bowl you'd like to use
        for your ramen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about a tablespoon each of soy sauce, sriracha, and chili oil into
        the bottom of the bowl. The purpose of this is to give some more life
        and flavor to the ramen. Even if you don't like spicy, I'd still
        recommend adding at least a little bit of sriracha and chili oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grab another saucepan and fill it with two cups of chicken broth. Bring
        the broth to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once brought to a boil, open up your instant ramen package and throw the
        noodle block in the broth. Allow it to cook for 3 minutes stirring
        occassionally as per the instructions.
      </li>
      <li>Once the noodles are done, pour the ramen into your bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Top off the noodles with your chicken, egg (sliced in half), spinach,
        and diced green onion.
      </li>
      <li>Congrats, it's time to eat!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Other tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you've never experienced ramen at a Japanese Ramen restaurant, my
        first tip would be to go do that! Experience ramen the way it was meant
        to be. Try out the different styles they offer and take in all the
        different flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        I used chicken ramen and topping, but feel free to experiment with other
        ramen flavors and protein toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to experiment with making the ramen more authentic, find an
        asian market in your area. Here you'll find many options for instant
        ramens/noodles, some of which are inspired by the traditional styles,
        such as Tonkatsu ramen. You'll also be able to find ingredients to use
        as toppings (such as kimchi) and you may be able to find aroma oils.
        Black garlic oil is a very common one that can actually be made at home
        too.
