        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The spaghetti recipe is extremely simple. The sauce is a simple mix of seasoned ground beef and a jar of spaghetti sauce that is set to a low simmer for 30-60 minutes. Once the sauce is close to being done, cook the noodles and voila, you are ready to serve!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>20-24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce of choice</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>onion powder</li>
            <li>canola, vegetable, or olive oil</li>
            <li>fresh shredded basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef on a cutting board and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
            <li>Set a large pan to medium-high heat. After allowing the pan to come up to temperature, add 2 tbsps of oil to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoned ground beef to the pan. After letting it sear for 2 minutes, mix the beef until it is cooked to a light brown.</li>
            <li>Add the jar of spaghetti sauce to the pan. Mix it around with the beef.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid and set to a low-simmer. Allow the sauce to simmer for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>After allowing the sauce to simmer for 20-40 minutes, it is time to begin the noodles.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot a little more than halfway with water. Set the pot to high-heat and add a large pinch of salt to the water.</li>
            <li>Once the water begins to boil, add the noodles. Stir the noodles a bit so they loosen up and are submerged by the water.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to medium and allow to simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once 10 minutes has passed, use a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon the place the noodles in a strainer.</li>
            <li>Add about a 1/4 of a cup of the leftover pasta water and the noodles to the sauce and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>You are ready to serve, enjoy!</li>
